# BlackJack

This is a functioning BlackJack game built with Object Oriented Structure.I included 5 classes(deck, player, card,
gameconsole, and playgame), with 2 enums(Rank, Suit). The game starts with simple instructions. The player types begin or "q" 
for quit. Upon beginning the player enters their name for a slight touch of personalization. Behind the scenes, the cards are
dealt in the correct order. Both cards are not dealt at once to either player, but in an order as if going around the table. 
The display needs some work. All of the first round cards are displayed at once, and both of the dealers cards are displayed
to the user. I also do not like my GameConsole class. This class is where all of my game's logic is running. I need to break
the play method into several smaller methods due to too much repitition.
